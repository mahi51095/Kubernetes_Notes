# 📦 What is a Static Pod?

A **Static Pod** in Kubernetes is a pod that is not managed by the Kubernetes API server directly, but rather is managed by the **Kubelet** on a specific node.  
These pods are defined by configuration files placed on the **node’s filesystem** (e.g., `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/`).

## ✨ Key Characteristics of Static Pods

### 1. 🚫 Not Managed by the Scheduler
- Not created by Deployments, ReplicaSets, or other controllers.
- Directly created and managed by the **Kubelet**.

### 2. 🖥️ Node-Specific
- Defined on a specific node only.
- Cannot be moved or scheduled by Kubernetes.

### 3. 🔁 Self-Healing
- If deleted or crashes, **Kubelet** automatically recreates it.

### 4. 🔍 Not Managed by API Server
- Doesn’t appear via `kubectl get pods` by default.
- Can be checked using `kubectl describe node <node-name>`.

---

## 💼 Use Cases

- 🔧 **System-Level Services**: kube-proxy, monitoring agents, log shippers.
- 💻 **Node-Specific Apps**: Single-node monitoring/infra tools.
- 🧠 **Kubernetes Core Components**: `kube-apiserver`, `kube-controller-manager`, etc.

## ⚙️ How Static Pods Work

1. **Pod Specification File**: YAML/JSON file stored locally.
2. **Kubelet Watches Directory**: Usually `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/`.
3. **Kubelet Manages Lifecycle**: Starts, stops, restarts the static pod as needed.

## 📝 Static Pod YAML Example

### 📂 nginx-static-pod.yaml
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-static
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

## 🚀 Steps to Create a Static Pod

### 🔹 Step 1: Create YAML File
- Save the above YAML as `nginx-static-pod.yaml`.

### 🔹 Step 2: Move to Static Pod Directory
```bash
sudo mv nginx-static-pod.yaml /etc/kubernetes/manifests/
```

### 🔹 Step 3: Kubelet Detects & Starts Pod
- Automatically picked up by the Kubelet.
- Pod starts running on that node.

### 🔹 Step 4: Check Pod Status
```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
kubectl describe node <node-name>
```

### 🔹 Step 5: Manage Pod Lifecycle
- If YAML file is removed → Pod deleted.
- If container crashes → Kubelet restarts it.

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- 🧭 Not visible in API server by default.
- ⚙️ Managed by Kubelet, not the scheduler.
- 📍 Tied to the node and defined via local file.

## ✅ Advantages

1. 🔁 **Self-Healing** via Kubelet
2. 🎯 **Node-Specific Deployments**
3. 🛠️ **Simplified Setup** for system-level tasks

---

## ⚠️ Disadvantages

1. ❌ No central **scheduling or scaling**
2. 🧩 Harder to manage **at scale**
3. 🐢 No built-in **replication** or **rolling updates**
